* LPC UART Calculator *
***********************

This simple program permits to compute UART initialization register values
for NXP's LPC111x MCU family.

Algorithm is directly taken from NXP User Manual (chapter 13.5.15 of
UM10398.pdf file).

It accepts UART Peripheral Clock (UART_PCLK) and baudrate as input.
(UART_PCLK is directly derived from main clock by means of UARTCLKDIV register).

Sample output:

$ ./lpc-uart-calc 12000000 115200
DIVADDVAL = 5 (0x5)
MULVAL = 8 (0x8)
DLM = 0 (0x00)
DLL = 4 (0x04)
Desired Baudrate = 115200.00
Actual  Baudrate = 115384.62
Error = 0.16%
